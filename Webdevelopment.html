  <h2>Html AND css</h2>
   <p> Creating an entire website from scratch is not fun especially if you haven't a slightest clue on what you are doing. I started this webpage 3 weeks late and I'm lagging behind but I'm still perservering. Once I know HTML and CSS,It is much easier and you can then free style yourself and do what you want to do. </p>
    <p>The videos and the tutorials were extremely helpful and I was eventually able to understand what Mr Chew was talking about</p>
    <p>I decided to do with only HTML and CSS as this is my first time doing something like this.</p>
